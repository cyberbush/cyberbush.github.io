About Me
I architect scalable Generative AI systems and high-throughput data pipelines. Currently, I am completing my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Austin.

When I'm off the clock:

Outdoors: Originally from Idaho, I spend as much time as possible hiking in the mountains, fishing, and cooking wild game.

Travel: I love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures, from staying at Amazon lodges in Ecuador to discovering new spots around the globe.

Local: I'm a big hockey fan and love cheering on the Dallas Stars.

When listing your Capital One experience, we are putting your RAG and Big Data work front and center.

Software Engineer | Capital One
(Feb 2023 - Present)

Led a strategic GenAI initiative to decode complex business logic, architecting a RAG-based AI system.

Utilized LangChain and ChromaDB to index 400k+ lines of Scala, a project projected to save 20+ weekly engineering hours.

Optimized LLM reliability by implementing syntax-aware recursive chunking and strict system prompt constraints to suppress hallucinations.

Engineered a Spark-based data pipeline for migrating 2B+ transactions across 13M+ accounts.

Optimized pipeline runtime by 60%+ through strategic AWS EMR scaling, data-caching, and node partitioning.

Modernized a critical auto-loan ingestion system by consolidating 8 disparate Kafka streams into a unified Spark component, eliminating legacy architectural debt.

Delivered a subscription and billing portal MVP using Zuora and Stripe APIs, driving $50M/month in platform revenue.

Software Engineering Intern | Capital One
(Jun 2022 - Aug 2022)

Built a real-time data service to unify marketing streams, improving data consistency for analytic dashboards.
