 Work Experience	


Software Engineer at Capital One  					                                                         Feb 2023 - Current
Led a strategic GenAI initiative to decode complex business logic, architecting a RAG-based AI system using LangChain and ChromaDB to index 400k+ lines of Scala; projected to save the team 20+ weekly engineering hours.
Optimized LLM reliability by implementing syntax-aware recursive chunking and strict system prompt constraints, suppressing hallucinations and ensuring answers were grounded purely in the retrieved Scala context.
Engineered a Spark-based data pipeline for migrating 2B+ transactions for 13M+ accounts, optimizing runtime by 60%+ through strategic EMR scaling, data-caching, and node partitioning.
Delivered a subscription and billing portal MVP using Zuora and Stripe APIs; implemented secure payment iframes and invoice tables that enabled 3,000+ dealers to manage payments, driving $50M/month in platform revenue.
Modernized a critical auto-loan ingestion system by consolidating 8 disparate Kafka streams into a unified Spark component, eliminating legacy architectural debt and executing a risk-managed rollout with delta monitoring.
Validated 2B+ migrated transactions using Snowflake and SQL, executing comprehensive audits to certify 100% data accuracy, preventing downstream errors and enabling the final legacy system cutover.
Deployed event-driven cloud infrastructure (AWS CloudWatch, SNS, SQS), creating custom monitoring dashboards to ensure real-time insights for national platform rollouts.
Software Engineering Intern at Capital One						                         Jun 2022 - Aug 2022
Built a real-time data service to unify marketing streams, improving data consistency for analytic dashboards.
 Projects

AI Meeting Summarizer – Generative AI Hackathon                                                    Capital One, Aug 2024 -- Top 10/53 Teams
Spearheaded a 4-person team to develop a NLP pipeline utilizing the Mistral LLM for processing Zoom transcripts, generating concise summaries, and extracting actionable items, delivered via a Slack Agent integration.
Advanced to the final round (Top 10 out of 270+ ideas) and pitched the end-to-end GenAI solution directly to Capital One leadership.
ML Breast Cancer Detection – Data Science Competition                                            University of Idaho, Sep 2022 -- 2nd Place
Developed a machine vision classifier using PyTorch and EfficientNet-B4 to analyze ultrasound imagery, achieving 80.16% accuracy (surpassing human benchmarks of 70%).
Designed an image processing pipeline for robust data augmentation (rotation, scaling) and utilized k-fold cross-validation to resolve class imbalance and maximize model generalization.
